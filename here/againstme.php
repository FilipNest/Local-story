  <h1>Against Me</h1>
  <h2>By Amy Gibb</h2>
</div>

<p>It was the worst day of my life. Everything was going wrong.  No joke. The whole world was against me, and I am 15mins behind the world anyway – I was screwed.</p>

<p>It was a [dayofweek]. That always spells trouble. I was cat-sitting for my mate in [neighborhood|2]. I had never stayed there before and everything was off kilter. I am also allergic to cats. Joy.</p>

<p>I set out on my journey of hell. I forgot my phone charger, and I ran out of battery just as I was reached [train station|2].  The trains were not running, so there was no way me to get into [train station|2|city]. The weather was [weather] and I sat on a bus – willing it to go faster and to not stop outside every [supermarket|2] it passes.</p>

<p>Sweat trickled down my spine. The bus crawled. I recounted a silent, obscene hatemessage to the rest of the world, whilst willing a telepathic message of apology to the nicest guy in the world. By now I was 30minutes late, with no real excuse other than ineptitude.</p>

<p>I pass over [bridge|1] and go past [park|3]. The bus pulls in and I run. I run to as fast as I can. Almost an hour late.</p>

<p>My heartbeat stops. He’s there waiting.</p>
