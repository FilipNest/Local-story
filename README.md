# Local stories

Local Stories is a tool by Filip Hn√≠zdo for localising text for its reader. It was created for making relative fiction that changes depending on where a reader is, what the weather is like and what time of day or year it is. It uses geolocation, the Foursquare venues API, the OpenWeatherMap API and a lot of PHP time and date functions.

Visit http://relativefiction.com to find out more about the project, its syntax and how it works.

The server side is in very experimental launch stages but if you would like to give it a go, download the files, register for an Openweathermap and Foursquare API account, put these details in secrets.php and then make a POST call to story.php .  Full server side API instructions will follow once things get cleaned up a bit but reading the files should give you an idea.

Get in touch if you need help. Please contribute if you can. I've released the code under the Apache 2 licence at the moment but this can probably change if you suggest good reasons for it to.
