    <h1>There's always [Park|1]</h1>

    <p>It was [day]. I got off at [Train station|1]. The weather was mostly [weather] so I went over to [Park|1] but then realised that it was too busy so I went to [Park|2] instead. This was better than [Park|1] anyway. I felt like seeing some animals, so I took a trip to [Zoo|1] after relaxing for a bit.</p>

    <p>I then returned to [Park|1] and read my book before going for lunch in [Japanese Restaurant|1] with a friend.</p>
