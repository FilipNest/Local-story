    <h1>There's always [Park|1]</h1>

    <p>It was [weather] so I went over to [Skate Park|1] but then realised that it was too busy so I went to [Skate Park|2] instead. This was better than [Skate Park|1] anyway. And it was quite close to [Aquarium|1] so I went to see the fish there.</p>

    <p>I then sat in [Park|1] for a bit and read my book before going for lunch in [restaurant|1].</p>
